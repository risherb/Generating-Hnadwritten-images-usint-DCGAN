# Generating-Handwritten-images-using-DCGAN
Using DCGAN to generate handwritten images involves two neural networks: a generator that creates fake images and a discriminator that tries to identify them as real or fake. Both networks improve over time, leading to the generator producing realistic handwritten images, often based on datasets like MNIST.
